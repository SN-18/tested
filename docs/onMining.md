Table1:
Good division of algorithms. Lately Iâ€™ve also been categorizing algorithms into
- Predictive: what is  (regression, classification)
- Optimization: what to change
- Generative: what else ?  (Markov chain, neural, bayesian, association rules)

btw, symbols and numbers  are different.

fro association rule lerning to generative networks. learn expectataions. reproduce them. same problem needed in optimization.
