# Automated Software Engineering and "Fishing"

XXX ungood good

Consider the polar bear
- she can walk all over on top of the ice
- but she cannot see through the ice to find the fish
- and can only cut a few holes per day

More generally,"fishing" is that process
of prioritizing many things, without knowing too much about every thing.
 - and when done, you want  a model  that speeds things up in future

And this needs some human-scale testing:
- given columns divided into `i.y` goals and `i.x` other columns
- you can look around all the `i.x`  columns
- but you can only look  at a few `i.y` columns 

Human-scale testing:
- Knowledge elicitation techniques like
  repertory grids take a while to complete; ei.g.
  up to an hour for two people to discuss, in detail,
  the differences between 10 examples described in 10 attributes.
- Valerdi [^val11] once recruited 40 experts to three panel
  sessions to review an effort model. Each panel took three hours so,
  on total, this study required 3 × 3 × 40/7.5 = 48 days to complete.
  He offers the heuristic that training data needs 5 to 10
  examples per column; i.e., the fewer the columns, the less is
  required for calibration. 
- Brendon Murphy
  [^mur12] from Microsoft  comments that the high cost of
  interpretation implies that there is never enough time to review
  all the defect data or all the models generated by the data miners.
  Hence, he is very interested in methods that reduce the number of
  columns and rows of data that need to be discussed with users.
- Complex systems are so complex that no one can test all the cases.
  So instead, when software engineers explore safety critical systems,
  the seek to cover "assurance cases" ie

So here we explore how much we
"Science is what we understand well enough to explain     
to a computer. Art is everything else we do"    
- Donald Knuth

With automated software engineering, are you an artist or a scientist?
Do you understand how to implement multi-objective semi-supervised explanations?
Probably not, yet.  

So lets lay it out, slowly. What might surprise you is,
as seen in the
[fish1.lua](/src/fish1.lua) 
system,
all this can be coded in a few hundred lines of code.

To understand this code, think in layers:
- Layer1:  written in LUA
- Layer2: command-line script
- Layer3: that supports  a generic data model which, in turn supports:
- Layer4: multi-objective semi-supervised explanation

The thing to note in the following is that across all the scripts used here, there is much common
structure-- which is kind of deep point; i.e. under-the-hood there is much commonality in 
the algorithms people call "optimization", "data mining", "explanation", etc.

## Layer1: LUA

LUA is an ultra lightweight scripting language comprising
less than two dozen keywords:
**and, break, do, else, elseif, end, false, for, function, if, in, local, nil, not, or, repeat, return, then, true, until, while**.
LUA has a considerably
smaller footprint than other programming languages, with its complete
source code and documentation taking a mere 1.3 MB.

I use LUA as an executable specification language. Students rewrite
my code in whatever language they like (that is not LUA). 
So to understand 
[fish1.lua](/src/fish1.lua) 
you do not need to run my LUA-- you only need to read it.

- For quick tutorials on LUA, see  [learnlua](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/)
- For full details on LUA, see the [Programming in LUA](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) book.

If you sqint and 
```lua
local SYM = lib.obj"SYM"
function SYM:new() --> SYM; constructor
  self.n   = 0
  self.has = {}
  self.most, self.mode = 0,nil end

function SYM:add(x) --> nil;  update counts of things seen so far
  if x ~= "?" then
   self.n = self.n + 1
   self.has[x] = 1 + (self.has[x] or 0) -- if "x" not seen before, init counter to 0
   if self.has[x] > self.most then
     self.most,self.mode = self.has[x], x end end end

function SYM:mid(x) --> n; return the mode
  return self.mode end

function SYM:div(x) --> n; return the entropy
  local function fun(p) return p*math.log(p,2) end
  local e=0; for _,n in pairs(self.has) do e = e - fun(n/self.n) end
  return e end
```

```lua
-- ## NUM
-- Summarizes a stream of numbers.
local NUM = lib.obj"NUM"
function NUM:new() --> NUM;  constructor;
  self.n, self.mu, self.m2 = 0, 0, 0
  self.lo, self.hi = math.huge, -math.huge end

function NUM:add(n) --> NUM; add `n`, update min,max,standard deviation
  if n ~= "?" then
    self.n  = self.n + 1
    local d = n - self.mu
    self.mu = self.mu + d/self.n
    self.m2 = self.m2 + d*(n - self.mu)
    self.sd = (self.m2 <0 or self.n < 2) and 0 or (self.m2/(self.n-1))^0.5
    self.lo = math.min(n, self.lo)
    self.hi = math.max(n, self.hi) end end

function NUM:mid(x) return self.mu end --> n; return mean
function NUM:div(x) return self.sd end --> n; return standard deviation
```

## Layer2: Scripting

All my code has some common features:

Initial help text. 


LUA is a language that is said to "not be provided with batteries".
This means that its libraries are kept to the minimum necessary to
do some stuff. Some people like PYTHON better since it comes with
a very large set of standard libraries. Some people like LUA cause
it doesn't (



```lua
-- Two dashes start a one-line comment.

--[[
     Adding two ['s and ]'s makes it a
     multi-line comment.
--]]

----------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Variables and flow control.
----------------------------------------------------

num = 42  -- All numbers are doubles.
-- Don't freak out, 64-bit doubles have 52 bits for
-- storing exact int values; machine precision is
-- not a problem for ints that need < 52 bits.

s = 'walternate'  -- Immutable strings like Python.
t = "double-quotes are also fine"
u = [[ Double brackets
       start and end
       multi-line strings.]]
t = nil  -- Undefines t; Lua has garbage collection.

-- Blocks are denoted with keywords like do/end:
while num < 50 do
  num = num + 1  -- No ++ or += type operators.
end

-- If clauses:
if num > 40 then
  print('over 40')
elseif s ~= 'walternate' then  -- ~= is not equals.
  -- Equality check is == like Python; ok for strs.
  io.write('not over 40\n')  -- Defaults to stdout.
else
  -- Variables are global by default.
  thisIsGlobal = 5  -- Camel case is common.

  -- How to make a variable local:
  local line = io.read()  -- Reads next stdin line.

  -- String concatenation uses the .. operator:
  print('Winter is coming, ' .. line)
end

-- Undefined variables return nil.
-- This is not an error:
foo = anUnknownVariable  -- Now foo = nil.

aBoolValue = false

-- Only nil and false are falsy; 0 and '' are true!
if not aBoolValue then print('twas false') end

-- 'or' and 'and' are short-circuited.
-- This is similar to the a?b:c operator in C/js:
ans = aBoolValue and 'yes' or 'no'  --> 'no'

karlSum = 0
for i = 1, 100 do  -- The range includes both ends.
  karlSum = karlSum + i
end

-- Use "100, 1, -1" as the range to count down:
fredSum = 0
for j = 100, 1, -1 do fredSum = fredSum + j end

-- In general, the range is begin, end[, step].

-- Another loop construct:
repeat
  print('the way of the future')
  num = num - 1
until num == 0


----------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Functions.
----------------------------------------------------

function fib(n)
  if n < 2 then return 1 end
  return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)
end

-- Closures and anonymous functions are ok:
function adder(x)
  -- The returned function is created when adder is
  -- called, and remembers the value of x:
  return function (y) return x + y end
end
a1 = adder(9)
a2 = adder(36)
print(a1(16))  --> 25
print(a2(64))  --> 100

-- Returns, func calls, and assignments all work
-- with lists that may be mismatched in length.
-- Unmatched receivers are nil;
-- unmatched senders are discarded.

x, y, z = 1, 2, 3, 4
-- Now x = 1, y = 2, z = 3, and 4 is thrown away.

function bar(a, b, c)
  print(a, b, c)
  return 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42
end

x, y = bar('zaphod')  --> prints "zaphod  nil nil"
-- Now x = 4, y = 8, values 15..42 are discarded.

-- Functions are first-class, may be local/global.
-- These are the same:
function f(x) return x * x end
f = function (x) return x * x end

-- And so are these:
local function g(x) return math.sin(x) end
local g; g  = function (x) return math.sin(x) end
-- the 'local g' decl makes g-self-references ok.

-- Trig funcs work in radians, by the way.

-- Calls with one string param don't need parens:
print 'hello'  -- Works fine.


----------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Tables.
----------------------------------------------------

-- Tables = Lua's only compound data structure;
--          they are associative arrays.
-- Similar to php arrays or js objects, they are
-- hash-lookup dicts that can also be used as lists.

-- Using tables as dictionaries / maps:

-- Dict literals have string keys by default:
t = {key1 = 'value1', key2 = false}

-- String keys can use js-like dot notation:
print(t.key1)  -- Prints 'value1'.
t.newKey = {}  -- Adds a new key/value pair.
t.key2 = nil   -- Removes key2 from the table.

-- Literal notation for any (non-nil) value as key:
u = {['@!#'] = 'qbert', [{}] = 1729, [6.28] = 'tau'}
print(u[6.28])  -- prints "tau"

-- Key matching is basically by value for numbers
-- and strings, but by identity for tables.
a = u['@!#']  -- Now a = 'qbert'.
b = u[{}]     -- We might expect 1729, but it's nil:
-- b = nil since the lookup fails. It fails
-- because the key we used is not the same object
-- as the one used to store the original value. So
-- strings & numbers are more portable keys.

-- A one-table-param function call needs no parens:
function h(x) print(x.key1) end
h{key1 = 'Sonmi~451'}  -- Prints 'Sonmi~451'.

for key, val in pairs(u) do  -- Table iteration.
  print(key, val)
end

-- _G is a special table of all globals.
print(_G['_G'] == _G)  -- Prints 'true'.

-- Using tables as lists / arrays:

-- List literals implicitly set up int keys:
v = {'value1', 'value2', 1.21, 'gigawatts'}
for i = 1, #v do  -- #v is the size of v for lists.
  print(v[i])  -- Indices start at 1 !! SO CRAZY!
end
-- A 'list' is not a real type. v is just a table
-- with consecutive integer keys, treated as a list.

----------------------------------------------------
-- 3.1 Metatables and metamethods.
----------------------------------------------------

-- A table can have a metatable that gives the table
-- operator-overloadish behavior. Later we'll see
-- how metatables support js-prototypey behavior.

f1 = {a = 1, b = 2}  -- Represents the fraction a/b.
f2 = {a = 2, b = 3}

-- This would fail:
-- s = f1 + f2

metafraction = {}
function metafraction.__add(f1, f2)
  sum = {}
  sum.b = f1.b * f2.b
  sum.a = f1.a * f2.b + f2.a * f1.b
  return sum
end

setmetatable(f1, metafraction)
setmetatable(f2, metafraction)

s = f1 + f2  -- call __add(f1, f2) on f1's metatable

-- f1, f2 have no key for their metatable, unlike
-- prototypes in js, so you must retrieve it as in
-- getmetatable(f1). The metatable is a normal table
-- with keys that Lua knows about, like __add.

-- But the next line fails since s has no metatable:
-- t = s + s
-- Class-like patterns given below would fix this.

-- An __index on a metatable overloads dot lookups:
defaultFavs = {animal = 'gru', food = 'donuts'}
myFavs = {food = 'pizza'}
setmetatable(myFavs, {__index = defaultFavs})
eatenBy = myFavs.animal  -- works! thanks, metatable

-- Direct table lookups that fail will retry using
-- the metatable's __index value, and this recurses.

-- An __index value can also be a function(tbl, key)
-- for more customized lookups.

-- Values of __index,add, .. are called metamethods.
-- Full list. Here a is a table with the metamethod.

-- __add(a, b)                     for a + b
-- __sub(a, b)                     for a - b
-- __mul(a, b)                     for a * b
-- __div(a, b)                     for a / b
-- __mod(a, b)                     for a % b
-- __pow(a, b)                     for a ^ b
-- __unm(a)                        for -a
-- __concat(a, b)                  for a .. b
-- __len(a)                        for #a
-- __eq(a, b)                      for a == b
-- __lt(a, b)                      for a < b
-- __le(a, b)                      for a <= b
-- __index(a, b)  <fn or a table>  for a.b
-- __newindex(a, b, c)             for a.b = c
-- __call(a, ...)                  for a(...)

----------------------------------------------------
-- 3.2 Class-like tables and inheritance.
----------------------------------------------------

-- Classes aren't built in; there are different ways
-- to make them using tables and metatables.

-- Explanation for this example is below it.

Dog = {}                                   -- 1.

function Dog:new()                         -- 2.
  newObj = {sound = 'woof'}                -- 3.
  self.__index = self                      -- 4.
  return setmetatable(newObj, self)        -- 5.
end

function Dog:makeSound()                   -- 6.
  print('I say ' .. self.sound)
end

mrDog = Dog:new()                          -- 7.
mrDog:makeSound()  -- 'I say woof'         -- 8.

-- 1. Dog acts like a class; it's really a table.
-- 2. function tablename:fn(...) is the same as
--    function tablename.fn(self, ...)
--    The : just adds a first arg called self.
--    Read 7 & 8 below for how self gets its value.
-- 3. newObj will be an instance of class Dog.
-- 4. self = the class being instantiated. Often
--    self = Dog, but inheritance can change it.
--    newObj gets self's functions when we set both
--    newObj's metatable and self's __index to self.
-- 5. Reminder: setmetatable returns its first arg.
-- 6. The : works as in 2, but this time we expect
--    self to be an instance instead of a class.
-- 7. Same as Dog.new(Dog), so self = Dog in new().
-- 8. Same as mrDog.makeSound(mrDog); self = mrDog.

----------------------------------------------------

-- Inheritance example:

LoudDog = Dog:new()                           -- 1.

function LoudDog:makeSound()
  s = self.sound .. ' '                       -- 2.
  print(s .. s .. s)
end

seymour = LoudDog:new()                       -- 3.
seymour:makeSound()  -- 'woof woof woof'      -- 4.

-- 1. LoudDog gets Dog's methods and variables.
-- 2. self has a 'sound' key from new(), see 3.
-- 3. Same as LoudDog.new(LoudDog), and converted to
--    Dog.new(LoudDog) as LoudDog has no 'new' key,
--    but does have __index = Dog on its metatable.
--    Result: seymour's metatable is LoudDog, and
--    LoudDog.__index = LoudDog. So seymour.key will
--    = seymour.key, LoudDog.key, Dog.key, whichever
--    table is the first with the given key.
-- 4. The 'makeSound' key is found in LoudDog; this
--    is the same as LoudDog.makeSound(seymour).

-- If needed, a subclass's new() is like the base's:
function LoudDog:new()
  newObj = {}
  -- set up newObj
  self.__index = self
  return setmetatable(newObj, self)
end

----------------------------------------------------
-- 4. Modules.
----------------------------------------------------


-- Suppose the file mod.lua looks like this:
local M = {}

local function sayMyName()
  print('Hrunkner')
end

function M.sayHello()
  print('Why hello there')
  sayMyName()
end

return M

-- Another file can use mod.lua's functionality:
local mod = require('mod')  -- Run the file mod.lua.

-- require is the standard way to include modules.
-- require acts like:     (if not cached; see below)
local mod = (function ()
  <contents of mod.lua>
end)()
-- It's like mod.lua is a function body, so that
-- locals inside mod.lua are invisible outside it.

-- This works because mod here = M in mod.lua:
mod.sayHello()  -- Says hello to Hrunkner.

-- This is wrong; sayMyName only exists in mod.lua:
mod.sayMyName()  -- error

-- require's return values are cached so a file is
-- run at most once, even when require'd many times.

-- Suppose mod2.lua contains "print('Hi!')".
local a = require('mod2')  -- Prints Hi!
local b = require('mod2')  -- Doesn't print; a=b.

-- dofile is like require without caching:
dofile('mod2.lua')  --> Hi!
dofile('mod2.lua')  --> Hi! (runs it again)

-- loadfile loads a lua file but doesn't run it yet.
f = loadfile('mod2.lua')  -- Call f() to run it.

-- loadstring is loadfile for strings.
g = loadstring('print(343)')  -- Returns a function.
g()  -- Prints out 343; nothing printed before now.
```

## Background

## Lets Go "Fishing"
Consider the following tasks:
- What is the same across all of them? 
- What is learned for "February"; i.e.  if we run did an audit in January, then in February,
    what have we learned from January that makes February easier?


    And, assuming we have to repeat these tasks (say) once every month, what
If analysts used budget $B_0$ in January to reach some conclusions, 
You are the captain of a fishing boat.
Your boat has a crew of six. Each day, before you catch
  anything, you waste hours burning expensive fuel traveling between promising
  fishing spots. What  software help you look at the ocean and find the fish faster?

You've need a car for Monday but you aren't really sure what kind
  you like. After a day of going to car yards, and doing a few test
  drives, you buy a car. Can software help you narrow down how many cars you need to look at?

<a href="/etc/img/build.png"><img width=400 align=right src="/etc/img/build.png"></a>
You are an architect trying to design houses with
  a house with lots of light but no glare. You client is a busy (and fussy) person and before
  you show them all the possible designs, can software help you prune them back to an interesting subset?

You are the manager of a software project, with many tricks for running a project.
  Any one project uses just a few of those tricks, but which one to apply?
  Can software  help you learn which tricks are best (and wish to avoid)?

Your software is being assessed by a focus group (a set of stakeholders).
  Your software is complex and this group has limited time to understand
  it and certify that the software is behaving reasonably[^green].

Software analytics learn models from data. Data labels are often incorrect[^tu] and
so they need to be checked before they are used. But data sets can be huge, and relabelling
everything can be so expensive. So can our software tells us what is the least number  of
examples to label?

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01719.pdf
"We
compare the time required to label commits from 50
projects via EMBLEM of manual means. Assuming we
were paying Mechanical Turk workers to perform that
labelling, then manual labelling would cost $320K and
39,000 hours (assuming pairs of workers per commit,
and a 50% cull rate for quality control). Using EMBLEM,
that same task would cost $40K and 4,940 hours; i.e.
it would be 8 times cheaper."

A software engineer can't try   options
but after a few experiments, they ship a product. For example:
- Data miners are controlled by billions of hyper-parameter options that control (e.g.)
    the shape of a neural net or how many neighbors your use for classification[^nn].
    These parameters let you trade off (e.g.) how many mistakes you tolerate
    versus how many results you return; or accuracy versus fairness[^cruz21].
- MySQL's Makefile has billions of configurations options, each of
    which means your SQL queries take different times to run and use
    different energy.

## Let's say that another way.


|What|Notes}
|----:|:------|
| X   | inputs|
|Y    | goals|
|F    | maps X to Y|
|W    | weights on the goals|
|Z    | parameters controlling the learners that generates F|

<img width=400 align=right src="/etc/img/2space.png">

We seek  a mapping $F$ such that $Y=F(X)$ where:
- $X$ and $Y$ are sets of decisions and goals
- Often $|X| \gg |Y|$, i.e. there are usually more decisions and goals.
- We might have access to a set of weights $W$ for each $Y$ value;
  e.g. if $W_i<0$ then we might seek solutions that  minimize $Y_i$.
- Under the hood, we might also have $Z$, a set of hyper-parameters
  that control the algorithms that find $F$.
- Finally, there may or may not be some background knowledge $B$ which we can
  use to guide our analysis.

In all the examples above,
it was  cheap to sample $X$ and very, very, very expensive to sample $Y$:
- e.g. describing the ocean is much cheaper than sailing around it all day looking for fish
- e.g. listing the Makefile options within SQL is faster than compiling and testing each one,

Only some  subset of $X$ are observable and/or controllable (or, indeed, relevant to
    the task at hand).

There can be many goals $Y$ and some are  contradictory (e.g. security and availability
    can be mutually exclusive).
- If we cannot satisfy all goals, we explore trade-offs between them 
  (known as satisficing[^simon]).
- And in those cases, sometimes the exploration can be just (or more) 
  insightful than actually getting find an answer.
- Vilfredo Pareto:  <em> Give me the fruitful error any time, full of seeds, 
  bursting with its own corrections. You can keep your sterile truth for yourself.</em>

Historically, in the SE community this is known as _search-based software engineering_
[^search]:
- Which explores issues like:
  - What is the smallest set of test cases that covers all branches in this program?
  - What is the best way to structure the architecture of this system to enhance its maintainability?
  - What is the set of requirements that balances software development cost and customer satisfaction?
  - What is the best allocation of resources to this software development project?
  - What is the best sequence of refactoring steps to apply to this system?
- Using techniques like local search,  tabu search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, 
  and   hill climbing.

Having tried many of those, I now prefer
something called "landscape analysis" where  data mining divides up a problem (after
which _optimization_ is just a matter of finding the difference between good and bad divisions).

### Some High-Level Terms 

|What | Notes|
|----:|:------|
|Theorem provers | explores  a set constraints defined in $B$|
| Data miners |   tools for dividing up $X$ and/or $Y$|
| Optimizers |  methods for jumping between better and worse $X$ and/or $Y$ |
| Explanation| tools are methods for generating a useful succinct summary from all that was learned from the theorem provers + optimizers + data miners?  Here, _useful_ means if that summary is applied  to the data, then some $m \ll N$ good examples will be selected (and "good" means "has good $Y$ values).|

### Other Lower-Level Terms

|What | Terms|
|----:|:------|
|supervised inference|  At least one _Y_ value |
| regression | usually, for single numeric goals|
|classification | single symbolic goal|
|Semi-supervised learning|  When  we have many examples but only a small subset have $Y$ values... in which case we can do things like spreading out the available $Y$ values over clusters within the $X$ values.|
| Unsupervised learning |  When we have no $Y$ values... in which case we can do things like _cluster_ the $X$ variables then ask humans people to offer comments on each cluster.  To reduce labeling do a recursive binary clustering of the data down to leaf clusters of size $\sqrt{N}$. Then just label the median point of these $\sqrt{N}$ clusters.|
|Contrast learning | Finding a minimal difference between clusters.
|  Single goal optimization| single goal|
| Multi goal optimization | up to 3 goals|
| Many goal optimization | 4 or more|
|Hyper-parameter optimization| Optimization through $Z,Y$ space|

One way to build optimizers is to: 
- cluster on $X$
- sort each cluster of their average $Y$ values
- generate clusters between clusters with worse and better $Y$ values|

## Project 

(Note: you may not understand some parts of the following... yet;  patience, dear reader.)


Using at least 10 data set for [here](https://github.com/timm/tested/tree/main/etc/data)
write a 
multi-objective  
semi-supervised explanation system:
- Multi-objective; i.e. $|Y|>1$
- Semi-supervised; i.e. given $N$ examples, you only have a limited budget
  $B_0 \ll N$ of times you can access the $Y$ values of any one example.
- Explanation (bonus marks): extract some _useful_ succinct summary from the data
  - here, _useful_ means if that summary is applied  to the data, then some 
   $m \ll N$ good examples
    will be selected (and "good" means "has good $Y$ values).

Note: avoid many-goal problems at this point. That will be bonus marks, below.

Expected Sections:

- Introduction 
  - First 4 paras:
    1. Everyone does X
    2. There is a problem with X
    3. We have a novel insight that means that problem might be solvable
    4.  So here's what we did. 
  - Section 1.1 : Structure of this paper
    - List of research questions and a very brief summary of your answers
    - List of overall contributions (the elevator speech, why is this paper is good).
    - Caveats (for this study, we did not explore Z because of Y)
- Related work
  - What every else did in the past
  - Why that is not good enough, for our purposes (i.e. why are we not doing it some old way)
  - What system from past work is state of the art (and will be used in your comparisons)
  - Note: your related work section must:
    - show that you've read around regarding related work
    - demonstrate your understand the multi-objective semi-supervised explanation problem.
    - show that thinking that lead to this new method.
- Methods
  - Algorithms
  - Data
  - Performance measures
  - Summarization methods
    - statistical methods, what you selected and why
      - please demonstrate that you understand effect size and significance testing
    - explaining any novel visualizations you will use in your results section (if there are any)
  - Note: please demonstrate that you actually have a clear understanding of all these methods.
- Results
   - Run with different y-sampling budgets $B_0\in$ (10,25,50,100,200,500...):
     - For different methods 
        - Compare your preferred method
            - to at least one prior state-of-the-art method;
            - to just selection $B_0$ items at random
            - to one of more  human-level sampling process  (see  Table1 of Baltes et al.[^ralph])
        - Repeated 20 times (with different random number seeds)
        - Some presentation of median and spread of results over 20 runs 
        - Non-parametric effect size and significance tests
  - Perform a "prudence" study 
    - as sampling size increases, your proposed methods should get better
  - Discussion of your results divided into your research questions.
    - a clear commentary on what worked best
    - if any unusual results, then acknowledge them and comment on them
  - Tables, figures, with best results distinguished from the non-best
- Discussion
  - Threats to Validity
  - Discussion: any bigger picture insights not present in the rest of the text?
  - Future work: what you did not have time to do, what you suggest to do next
- Conclusion
- References

### Bonus marks

#### B1: Repeat the above for many-goal problems.

Defined above

#### B2: Perform a _REQUIREMENTS STUDY_
- For 5 humans, run 5 repertory grids studies. 
- Compare the results:
  - against a recursive bi-clustering  of the data plus
    some hierarchical feature selection
  - against results from other humans
  - Is there anyway way the intra-human views (or the view between human an data)
    can be aligned? (HINT: maybe not)
- Include a commentary on your experience with rep grids (any surprises?) 

#### B3: Perform a _FEBRUARY STUDY_ 
Requires an explanation facility, as described above.
- If analysts used budget $B_0$ in January to reach some conclusions, what is learned
   such that this kind of future analysis gets simpler.
- So pretend its February and we have come back to a some similar problem (like what was
      studied in January). Using what was learned in January, can the same task be solved
      with less budget $B_1 < B_0$?

#### B4: Perform an _ABLATION STUDY_
- Given a preferred method $M$ containing two to four main ideas
  - Disable (or change) each one  thing. If anything get worse, declare that thing important.

#### B5: Perform an _HPO study_
- Apply these minimal sampling methods to learning good $Z$ values for a learner
- Your goal should be to compare your minimal sampling methods with some established optimization method.

[^simon]: From Wikipeda: Satisficing (satisfy + suffice) =  a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic.
          Search through available alternatives till an acceptability threshold is met.i
          Introduced by Herbert A. Simon in 1956 to explain the behavior of decision makers
          under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined. 
          He maintained that many natural problems are characterized by
          computational intractability or a lack of information, 
          both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimization procedures.
          He observed in 
          his Nobel Prize in Economics speech that "decision makers can satisficed
          either by finding optimum solutions for a 
          simplified world, or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world.
          Neither approach, in general, 
          dominates the other, and both have continued to co-exist in the world of management science".

[^green]: Ben Green warns that many recent policies require 
          humans-in-the-loop to review or audit decisions from
          software model. People
          (including experts) are susceptible to “automation bias” (involving
          omission errors) failing to take action because the automated
          system did not provide an alert—and commission error. These
          omissions
          means that oversight policies can lead to the reverse of their
          desired effect by “legitimizing the use of faulty and controversial 
          algorithms without addressing (their fundamental issues)"
