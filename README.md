When trying new things, its good to thrash around for a while,
trying this and trying that. 

But afterwards, there should
be a clean-up stage where lessons learned from all the work are used
to
clarify and simplify the code.

So after 25 years of AI programming, here is my clean-up:

- The code
is delivered in tiny chunks, each one suitable for a weekly homework
for a graduate class.  
- The code is written in Lua which is a pretty
simple Python-like high-level language. I ask my students to recode
all this, in some non-Lua language.

Share and enjoy. And please, write [issues](http://github.com/timm/lua/issues)
about the stuff that does not work or could work better.
