# Hello!

TESTED is a set of data science coding assignments, written in Lua (which is a
small and simple Python-like language, but with far less overhead).
- Students use these samples as an executable specification which
they must reproduce in any other language they like (except Lua).
- Each of these assignments is about 1-2 weeks of work. 
- Hence, it is
suitable for homeworks or (by combining several modules) a large
end-of-term project.  

TESTED assumes that the best way to test something is to give it
to someone else, and watch them break it.  
- This is actually a core
principle of ethical programming.  
- Vance et al. [^Vance2016] argue that a
pre-condition for the accountability is the knowledge of an 
**external audience**, who could approve or disapprove of a system. 

Hence, TESTED has many tools for such external audiences:

- Operators for learning the boundaries of a systemâ€™s competency;
- Methods for looking beyond those boundaries (taken from cognitive
psychology); 
- Human-readable model generation methods that can
extract symbolic descriptions from training data (since that is
what humans need for explaining a system); 
- Cost-effect sampling
methods that let outsiders probe a system, looking for interesting
(or alarming) behavior.  
- Semi-supervised learners where algorithms
make conclusions based on a small sample of the total data space
(so humans are not overwhelmed with excessive questions).
